okay,
after going through the x11 and xcb manauls and and api pages, it 
they do not offer graphics utility like I was thinking either would be capable of
so because of this, we might still use these programs to draw to the root window of x11/dwm
but we will compiling our image with our gpu, which again I thought xcb/x11 would offer libraries that
allowed access ot the gpu but apparently not, so we will use either vulcan or cuda

cuda is the propriety api for communication with the nvidia corporations cpus

vulkan is a cross-platform graphics specific api

I think, as I am working with nvidia I will probably be using the cuda api, as it isnt necessarily built
for graphics applications either it willg ive me an interesting challenge, and also give me a better
understanding of graphics cards for industry use

yeah I think cuda is the way to go... I like hardware and there is simply no better way to use hardware
than the api specifically designed for it
